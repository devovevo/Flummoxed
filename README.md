# Controls:  
Flummoxed operates on the stand "wasd" keyboard layout for movement, and the "space" key for firing. This changes, however, in 2-player mode, where one player utilizes these standard controls and the other player controls their ships movement using the mouse (i.e. the ship follows their cursor), and fires by left-clicking.

# Gameplay:  
The main game cycle of Flummoxed consists of the player attempting to dodge or destroy a series of obstacles which descend from the top, left, and right of the screen. Obstacles include asteroids and satellite, with later enemies being UFOs, which drop watermelon projectiles that split into two when hit, and a Brain "boss" enemy which fires green projectiles and a non-moving laser beam.
